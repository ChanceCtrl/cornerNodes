# What is this?
The basis of the KS7x\_cornerNode^(tm) code, with a lot of stolen code from the MDB repo and even more stolen from old test code.

# It doesn't do anything?
Alot of work still needs to be done, none of this is tested and I am suprised some of this *thing* compiles to keep it a $1.50 with you...

# Why does it have like 16 files bro yo code sucks
I know :( 
I mostly wanted to keep each sensor in its own file to keep things readable and expandable, but with the way that the CAN ID generation code relies on a hard-coded class to make more IDs its not quite as drop in file and go as I want it to be and now it has like 16 files with very few benifets... Sorry
