# What is this?
The basis of the KS7x\_cornerNode^(tm) code, with a lot of stolen code from the MDB repo and even more stolen from old test code.

# How do I add a sensor or change a reading?
You make a .hpp file with your functions and code and what not (ideally a class), then just add a entry to the CAN_Lable_Maker.hpp, and add it to the loop in the main.cpp. Simple arduino stuffs, idk.

# It still sucks lmao
Yea, still need to clean up the way things like the pot get handeled, and make a class for wheel speeds so you can have more than 1 per node. idk still needs a lot of work...... .. . . . .. ... ..... .. . .. .  . .   .. . .
